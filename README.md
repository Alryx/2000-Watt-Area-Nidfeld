# 11 - Reduce car rides at traffic peak hours
How to cope with traffic on the Nidfeld 2000-Watt Site in Kriens (LU)

## Topic:
On the Nidfeld site in Kriens, a new neighborhood with apartments and commercial space is currently under construction. To avoid overloading the traffic situation in the area during peak hours, there is a given requirement (by the authorities) on how many cars are allowed to enter and leave the site between 17:00 CEST / 5 PM and 18:00 CEST / 6 PM.

The "Fahrtenmodell" that is available to the site developer Losinger Marazzi AG estimates that the maximum of 200 entrances and exits will be exceeded, once the new site is in use.

## Challenge:
Use the "Fahrtenmodell" to gain ideas about how to reduce the amount of car rides during the peak hour. Review / test your solutions based on the "Fahrtenmodell".

## Possible Solutions:
Losinger Marazziâ€™s current plan is to slow down the exit barrier in order to temporarily limit the number of exits. However, there must be a better solution than this. For example, there might be ways to create incentives for residents, workers and customers to either bypass the peak hour or use public transport, bicycles or car sharing. You are free to think out of the box and come up with solutions that help reducing the number of car rides to the allowed maximum.
